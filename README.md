# Python-scripts
This is just a repository with a bunch of python scripts on which I'm hoping to get better overtime, feel free to make suggestions on the code, they will be gratefully appreciated. Also, have to say that most of the scripts will be made for Python3

# Scripts made
* Python subnet calculator
* Python backup (kind of incremental?)
 - Don't know if should I use filecmp.cmp on the files (byte-to-byte) or just disutils with update=1 is enough...
* Python macro calculator, for nerds that workout!
* PublicIPython: find out your public IP and send it to your email, useful for dynamic IP servers at home for example. Using GMAIL smtp server for sending the mail, remember that you need to create a password for applications in order to the script to be used, otherwise GMAIL will reject your connection for more info: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=es of course if you have your own server just adjust the settings to your needs! ALSO you need bs4 module (beautifulsoup)

# Future projects
* Viper: a IDS for IoT --> written in full python3 with web interface made on Flask.

**HELP WANTED!** as this is gonna be an open-source project, which I would like to focus this summer, all help would be nice :) either are resources, ideas... Whatever you want! Feel free to contact with me on twitter (@AdSanz_IT)
