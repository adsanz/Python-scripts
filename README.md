# Python-scripts
This is just a repository with a bunch of python scripts on which I'm hoping to get better overtime, feel free to make suggestions on the code, they will be gratefully appreciated.

# Scripts made
* Python subnet calculator
* Python backup (kind of incremental?)
 - Don't know if should I use filecmp.cmp on the files (byte-to-byte) or just disutils with update=1 is enough...
* Python macro calculator, for nerds that workout!

# Future projects
* Viper: a IDS for IoT --> written in full python3 with web interface made on Flask.

**HELP WANTED!** as this is gonna be an open-source project, which I would like to focus this summer, all help would be nice :) either are resources, ideas... Whatever you want! Feel free to contact with me on twitter (@AdSanz_IT)
