# Python-scripts
Just a place where I'll drop my python scripts!

# Scripts made
* Python subnet calculator,
* Python backup for small folders,
* Python point counter (small project for a teacher, which is not over)
* Python macro calculator, for those nerds out there!

# Future projects
Viper: a IDS for IoT --> written in full python3 with web interface made on Flask
