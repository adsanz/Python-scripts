# Python-scripts
This is just a repository with a bunch of python scripts on which I'm hoping to get better overtime, feel free to make suggestions on the code, they will be gratefully appreciated.

# Scripts made
* Python subnet calculator
* Python backup for folders (planning on using file hash to compare the backed up file, and make somewhat of an incremental backup)
* Python point counter (small project for a teacher, which is not over)
* Python macro calculator, for nerds that workout!

# Future projects
* Viper: a IDS for IoT --> written in full python3 with web interface made on Flask.

**HELP WANTED!** as this is gonna be an open-source project, which I would like to focus this summer, all help would be nice :) either are resources, ideas... Whatever you want! Feel free to contact with me on twitter (@AdSanz_IT)
